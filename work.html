                <p>Currently, this is a collaborative project being worked on. The Anderson's are an elderly couple residing in England who need assistance managing their household owing to their age. We are required to construct an application utilizing the PHP framework laravel for the Anderson's where they will be able to track appointments, manage the workers employed by the Andersons, and track cooking. Since the application is still under development, I will only briefly describe its current state and focus primarily on the components that I am currently working on or have already finished.</p>

            <li class="">Create: You could add new users to the database using the create function.

            <li>
                Read: Using the read function, you could see a list of every user in the database. You would offer a table that shows user data, including name, email, and any other pertinent data. Additionally, you could add search and filtering capabilities to make it simpler to locate particular users.</li>
            <li>Update: Using the update function, you could change any existing user data that is stored in the database. You would offer a form that enables editing of user data, including name, email, password, and any other pertinent data. The data would be verified when the form was submitted, and the database would then be updated.</li>
            <li>Delete: You might eliminate user information from the database using the delete function. A button or link that, when clicked, would remove the user from the database would be provided.</li>
